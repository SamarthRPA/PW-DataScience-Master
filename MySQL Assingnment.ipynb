It is used to ensure that each row in a table is unique and to provide a way to reference each row from other tables. A primary key must be unique, cannot contain null values, and can consist of one or more columns. When a primary key is defined on a table, it creates an index that allows for faster searching and sorting of the data.

A foreign key can only contain values that exist in the referenced primary key column. For example, a \"customer_id\" column in an \"orders\" table could be defined as a foreign key that references the \"customer_id\" primary key in the \"customers\" table.
