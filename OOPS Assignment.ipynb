    "> Encapsulation: This is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data, and restricting access to that data by making it private. This helps to prevent unwanted modifications of the data, and to maintain code consistency.\n",

    ">Polymorphism: This is the concept of using the same interface to represent different data types. In other words, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class.\n",

    ">Abstraction: This is the concept of hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the necessary details to the user. This helps to reduce complexity and make the code more modular and easier to maintain."
